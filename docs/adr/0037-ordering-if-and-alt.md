# Ordering is jq's jv_cmp on an explicit stack; If and Alt join the IR

Status: accepted (2026-11-13, architect under `/run-spec` #56, ticket #66; designer draft); completes ADR-0029 for ordering; amends ADR-0005 (If, Alt, Truth), ADR-0008 (neither ticks) and ADR-0034 (comparison lowering); Alt and Collect after a break amended by ADR-0039 (#68)

#66 is the first ticket that orders values or branches on truth. S2a.23's orderers reuse its primitive, and #68 lowers `if` onto its If. Equality (`jv_equal`) is #65's (ADR-0034 amendment for #65); #66 builds `==` and `!=` on it.

## Decision

- **`Order.compare(RunState, a, b)`** follows jq 1.8.2's `jvp_cmp` step for step: the depth check (> 10 000 raises "Comparison too deep") first on every call, kinds null < false < true < number < string < array < object, a NaN side read as null at the same depth, strings by unsigned UTF-8 bytes then length, arrays element by element then length, objects by their sorted key lists (depth + 1, each key at + 2) and then their values in sorted-key order. Unlike equality it has no identity check. It runs on an explicit stack, never Java recursion. Every orderer calls it.
- **One number pair rule**: a three-way compare of two numbers (ADR-0012; jq's `jvp_number_cmp`) lives once and is shared by Order and #65's Equality. Its short path uses primitive comparison, so `-0` equals `0`; two Infinity literals of one sign are equal.
- **Ticks**: the member walks' own (#63, #82), one per key collected per side, one per member pair compared, one per started KiB of the shorter string or of a literal on the BigDecimal path. A sort's comparisons are never ticked, so counts do not depend on the sort. A comparison builds no value and charges no bytes built; its scratch key orders are not charged.
- **Lowering**: `l OP r` for `== != < <= > >=` binds its right operand outside its left, like the arithmetic operators (ADR-0034); an Identity or Const operand is passed as the argument.
- **`If(source, cond, then, otherwise, truth)` and `Alt(source, left, right, truth)`** take a query-core `Truth` predicate, passed as data like `Collector`; jq-core's is "neither false nor null". `a and b` is `If(a, If(b, T, F), F)`, `a or b` is `If(a, T, If(b, T, F))`, `not` is `If(., F, T)`: the left side is the outer loop. `Alt` emits each truthy left result and runs the right side only if there was none; it catches nothing (ADR-0008, observed). Neither node ticks.
- **Folding**: `ConstantKey` folds a comparison of two constants as jq's `constant_fold` does (any kind); `and`, `or` and `//` are not folded. A fold that raises folds to no constant.

## Considered options

- **Java recursion**: ends as ADR-0029's stack termination.
- **A second number rule inside Order**: the two could drift.
- **`String.compareTo` or `ByteBuffer.compareTo`**: UTF-16 order, and signed bytes.
- **Ticking the sort's comparisons**: the count would depend on the algorithm.
- **An identity check in compare**: `jvp_cmp` has none.
- **And and Or IR nodes**: If covers both, as in jq.
- **`//` as a Try**: it catches nothing.
