# Equality, ordering and object merge stop at jq's depth limits

Status: accepted (2026-11-12, owner, spec 2 grilling round 1, Q8); completed by ADR-0037 for ordering (#66)

jq 1.8.2 limits three recursive operations to a fixed depth: `jv_equal` (`MAX_EQUAL_DEPTH`, 10 000,
`src/jv.c`), `jv_cmp` (`MAX_CMP_DEPTH`, 10 000, `src/jv_aux.c`) and the deep object merge `*`
(`MAX_OBJECT_MERGE_DEPTH`, 10 000, `src/jv.c`). Past the limit jq raises the catchable errors
"Equality check too deep", "Comparison too deep" and "Object merge too deep"; jq.test checks them.
No earlier ADR covered them.

## Decision

- `==`, `!=`, the ordering operators and everything that orders (`sort`, `group_by`, `unique`,
  `min`, `max`, object key order) and object `*` follow jq: the same three constants, the same
  messages, catchable jq errors, not budgets and not terminations.
- They are not `Limits.nestingDepth` (the parse depth) and are not configurable: they are jq's
  semantics, not a resource limit.
- They are implemented without Java-stack recursion (an explicit stack), so a 10 000-deep value
  never reaches the stack backstop (ADR-0011).
- Where exactly each limit bites is jq-ref's: at 10 001 levels jq-ref returns `true` for `==` on
  nested arrays and merges nested objects with `*`, but raises "Comparison too deep" for `<` on
  nested objects. Differential cases pin each boundary on both sides.

## Considered options

- **`Limits.nestingDepth` for all three:** one knob, but a host that raises the parse depth would
  change what `==` returns, and jq's check-1 cases would depend on a setting.
- **Recursive Java code:** simplest, but on the 512 KiB default stack a deep compare ends as a STACK
  termination where jq returns a value or a catchable error.
