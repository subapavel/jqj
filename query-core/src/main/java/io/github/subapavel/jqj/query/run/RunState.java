/**
 * The budgets of one evaluation (ADR-0030, ADR-0008, ADR-0035): its fuel, the step budget, the deadline and the
 * bytes-built and bytes-written counts, in a phase that is idle, primed or running. The engine's Workspace owns one and hands it to each run, so it
 * is never shared between two running evaluations; it is not thread-safe.
 *
 * <p>A main read primes it: the run that begins next keeps the ticks counted since, less those the writer charged
 * through {@link #tickWritten} outside a run, so a large document counts against the run that consumes it and a print
 * between the read and the run does not. A read during a run is charged to that run. {@link #end} leaves every budget
 * unlimited until the next {@link #begin}: outside a run nothing is checked.
 *
 * <p>A tick is {@code if (--fuel < 0) refuel()}. Refuel comes every 4096 ticks, or at the step budget when that is
 * nearer, and checks the step budget, then the deadline, then the thread's interrupt.
 *
 * <p>The deadline counts from {@link #begin}, not from the read, so a host's pause between the two is not charged:
 * {@code begin} reads the clock, {@link System#nanoTime()}, once as the deadline's start. Refuel is the only place that
 * compares the clock with the deadline, so a run under 4096 ticks never checks it.
