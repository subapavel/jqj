Durable facts only (AGENTS.md, Memory). No ticket state. Under 120 lines.

## Carried over from flottila-mapping (2026-11-10; observed there, re-verify on first use here)

- Two-sided guards (`a.isEmpty() != b.isEmpty()`): PIT only negates the whole condition, so one
  half can go unwitnessed with a green mutation score. Check each half has a test case.
- "Equivalent mutant" claims: check them against the public seam, not the current implementation.
- Config-only guards and partial `&&` conditions in hand-written validators often ship with one
  case of several witnessed. Ask for one case per line.
- A seeded loop inside one `@Test` recurs: the standard is one parameterised case per seed, the
  seed in the name.
- A rule moved into one helper and claimed by its new test still needs a row per clause.
- Stale text after an ADR amendment: grep the code comments for the old wording.
- A fake that echoes what it was asked cannot witness a guarantee about that value: check port
  fakes against the ADR wording.
- Mutable accumulators carrying boolean "kind" flags: watch for a sealed type instead.
- Enforcer bans that one module lifts use `<phase>none</phase>` on the execution id; any child
  POM can lift one the same way, so grep diffs for those ids.
- `gh issue view` fails (GraphQL blocked); use `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/N` and
  `/comments`. The approved design is in the ticket comments, and it can sanction choices that
  look like standards deviations.
- (#33) Before prescribing a position assert, check it is jq-ref's (grilling item 7); a channel target has no flush, so "never flushed" on it is vacuous.
- (#34) Check each expected-value row against the `.rec`, not the comment; an oracle def is sha256(case..end lines + LF)[:12].
- (#36) Read a verify worktree's PIT `mutations.xml` only after the gate has finished; mid-run it can be empty.
- (#35) An empty @TestFactory map passes vacuously: a FAIL (CODING_STANDARDS Tests §1). jq's GitHub source is unreachable via gh here; translation checks rest on jq-ref recordings.
- (#61) A merge of the integration tip can bring in an ADR amendment newer than the approved design: read the ADR status lines on the tip, not the design comment.
- (#61) An op that calls the static `Printer.json` charges no ticks: check every new op that walks a value for `apply(RunState, …)`.
- (#61) A tick test whose budget sits far below the charge only proves something is charged; pin the rate with a pair (N completes, N−1 ends).
- (#62) Syntax-error stderr is not compared by the oracle, so token-name tables and lookahead sets are unit-test-only: count the witnessed rows.
- (#62) A hand-written parser over parser.y counts as a translation for NOTICE (Lexer.java precedent); error-recovery logic must name its source (Bison manual vs parser.c vs GPL yacc.c).
- (#62) F-13 is the JSON reader's depth limit; it does not cover the filter parser's recursion.
- (#63) The oracle runs without budgets, so every new `state.tick` needs its own adjacent budget pair: grep the diff for `tick(` and match each hit to a test.
- (#63) A `case JqValue other` total pattern counts as a default on a sealed type. `ObjectView.isFirst`/`lastValueOf`-style scans inside a walk are loops over data and need ticks (F-40).
- (#63) Sign-encoded or long-packed scan returns are this codebase's recurring hot-path idiom: raise once as a carry.
- (#64) A file headed "Translated from jq" must appear in NOTICE: diff NOTICE against `git grep -l "Translated from jq"`. A measured constant needs one absolute pin; one pair per rate cannot catch `*`→`/`, ask for two counts.
- (#64) DiffRunner skips stderr only for `jq: error: syntax error`; action-only compile errors are compared byte for byte.

- (#65) A constant-operand row (`1 + 2`) in a run-budget test is folded at parse time: check every filter in a budget test for a fold. An ADR rate list covers only the loops it names: grep each new loop over Members for a tick and match it to a rate. Diff NOTICE against `git grep -l "Translated from jq"` on every ticket.

- (#65) A budget started per operator inside a recursive fold does not bound the fold: a container of folds adds them up; check where each fold RunState begins. A time or out-of-memory test witnesses only that a bound exists; the bound value needs a pair at the bound. A shared helper with a flag that skips a tick for one caller: check that caller against ADR-0008.

- (#65) A shape check that repeats what a fold does can be hidden by the fold fallback: pick a case where only the shape decides. A parse-time fold has no step budget unless one is given: check compile-time arithmetic for O(n*m) work, and that each compile shares one fold budget.

- (#65) A resolver that folds top-down calls the fold at every level of a Binary chain: uncharged literal building multiplies by the chain depth. `min(cap, left)` where cap equals the total is an equivalent mutant. Number arithmetic charges no tick, so `1 + 2` is no "left to the run" witness.
- (#65) In every builder loop, check the collection call and where the charge sits: `addFirst` in a loop is O(n²), and a charge after the loop bounds nothing.
- (#65) `chargeBuilt` does not add the bytes when a charge fails, so a later, smaller fold can still fit; changing the fold order changes which nodes fold at the edge.
- (#65) A mutant argued but not run counts as killed if it under-charges more than a mutant already killed at the same check.
- (#66) `NumberView.doubleValue` re-scans its token on every call, while `LiteralNumber` caches its double. A "charges nothing" test built on a filter literal says nothing about a document literal.
- (#66) Under ADR-0014, required oracle cases count toward jq-core's mutation score (PIT crossModule), so a mutant killed only by such a case counts as killed.
- (#66) DiffRunner compares stderr unless the expected output has `jq: error: syntax error`.
- (#67) A Stub-list entry that gains ` | ..` loses its only check: find a positive witness for each construct the ticket lowers. Each new arm in `ConstantKey.fold` is a new charge and needs its own N/N+1 pair.
- (#67) When a Const lowering gives the same output as the general path, the oracle sees the difference only while that path is a Stub. The lasting check is a run under `bytesBuilt(0)`.
- (#68) For any walk that runs after the run (Detach), check four ways the cost can exceed what was charged: colliding keys (a HashMap keyed by ByteBuffer is not Comparable to its own class), shared built containers (`[.,.]` chains), repeated views of one document node, and leaf views and keys. Each needs a memo plus a time-bound red.
- (#68) An `int` counter whose "none" value is 0 collides once it wraps; grep RunState for int tokens.
- (#69) Compare each IR-shape witness with the ADR's lowering formula: a shape test can pin a lowering no ADR states. A contract that lives only in javadoc can change without contradicting an ADR, so check which future backends it binds. Check that a loop's slot is nulled on every exit.
- (#70) A depth guard that counts per Ast misses nesting built outside the counted branch (value-param Binds, chain Binds); measure the built IR as the verifier walks it, and witness every child arm with its own case — PIT mutates a switch return once.
- (#70) Deep-recursion edges depend on JVM state (JaCoCo frames ~1 KiB/level, class loading at depth); pin host stack claims in an agent-free child JVM and keep both sides of a bound pair in-suite for PIT.
- (#70) `assertThat(thrown).isNull()` is a no-exception assertion (Tests §2); `Inlining.MARK`: no test asserts Stub text.
