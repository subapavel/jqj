# jqj — rules for every agent

Open-source implementation of the jq language on Java 25: a jq filter is compiled once (to an IR,
then to an interpreter tree or JVM bytecode) and run directly over JSON bytes, without building an
object tree of the input. Speed and bounded memory are priorities. It is a standalone project that
Flottila will consume through an adapter living in the Flottila repo; nothing here depends on
Flottila code. Everything in the repo is in English.

This file is loaded into every context, so it holds only pointers and the rules nobody may break.

## Read before work

- `docs/FOUNDING-ARCHITECTURE.md` — the owner's agreed direction; grilling confirms it, never re-asks it.
- `GLOSSARY.md` — the project's language. Use its terms in code, tests, tickets and hand-backs.
- `AGENTS.md` — roles, ticket classes (A/B/C/G → model and effort), concurrency, evidence words.
- `docs/WORKFLOW.md` — how a spec goes from idea to `main`; read the section you are in.
- `agent/HANDOFF.md` — the current state and the next exact action (architect only).
- `docs/adr/` — decisions that bind the area you touch. Contradicting one is a finding, not a fix.
- `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md` — read by reviewers; writers read it when a hand-back is rejected.

Work items live in GitHub Issues (`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`): wayfinder maps, specs and
tickets with native blocking edges. There is no backlog file.

## Non-negotiable

- Red before green. A ticket starts from a failing check: a test, an oracle case or a ratchet entry.
- Never weaken, skip or delete a test, an oracle case or a ratchet entry to go green.
- Never claim a build, test, measurement or push you did not observe. Evidence words only
  (`VERIFIED_PASS`, `EXECUTED_FAIL`, `NOT_RUN`, `ENVIRONMENT_BLOCKED`, see `AGENTS.md`).
- Never edit ratchet files (`ratchet/`) by hand in a ticket; only the verifier regenerates them
  on the integration branch.
- Writers work only inside their worktree and the paths their ticket names.
- Library and JDK APIs: Context7 first, then `javap`. Never an API from memory.
- jq behaviour: the reference jq binary (`docs/agents/environment.md`) and jq's own test files
  decide what a filter does. Never a jq behaviour from memory; a difference we keep on purpose
  goes into `DEVIATIONS.md` with its reason.
- `query-core` never mentions JSON or jq (founding architecture §14).
- Dependencies: Apache 2.0, MIT, MIT-0, BSD, EDL 1.0, ISC, 0BSD, MPL 2.0, EPL only; a dual licence
  counts under its allowed alternative. The list covers every compile, runtime and test
  dependency. Exception: JMH in the benchmark module only. Maven plugins are tools, not
  dependencies (any OSI licence). A new exception is an ADR.
- Files copied or translated from jq (its function library written in jq, its test files, the
  `jv_parse.c` port of ADR-0015) keep jq's copyright
  notice and are listed in `NOTICE`. The manual's prose is not copied; its examples as jq's
  `man.test`/`manonig.test` carry them are test resources (ADR-0021).
- No secret, customer payload or real partner data in the repo; test inputs are synthetic.
- When practice contradicts an ADR or the architecture: write the finding (`docs/WORKFLOW.md` §7).

## Context hygiene

- Build and test output goes to `.logs/<ticket>-<check>.log`; read the tail or the failing
  section only.
- Large reads go to the scout. A hand-back is at most 40 lines.
- After a compaction: re-read `agent/HANDOFF.md`, run `git status` and `git log -3`, and treat
  everything older than the last hand-back as unknown.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues with sub-issues and native blocking. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical roles plus `class:*`, `oracle:*`, `spec`, `wayfinder:*`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single context: `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` at the root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
