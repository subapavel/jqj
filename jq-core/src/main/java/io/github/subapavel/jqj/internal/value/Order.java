/**
 * jq 1.8.2's {@code jv_cmp}, the value order every orderer uses (ADR-0037, ADR-0029; GLOSSARY "Value order",
 * "Comparison depth"). Each pair of values lies at a depth, the outermost at 0, and a pair deeper than
 * {@link #MAX_DEPTH} raises jq's catchable "Comparison too deep" before anything else is compared. Then the kinds
 * decide, null below false below true below numbers below strings below arrays below objects; within a kind numbers
 * compare by {@link Numbers}, a NaN side read as null at the same depth; strings by their UTF-8 bytes, unsigned, then
 * by length; arrays element by element, each pair one level deeper, then by length; objects by their key lists, sorted
 * by the same string order, as an array one level deeper whose keys lie two levels deeper, and then by their values in
 * that sorted order, one level deeper. There is no identity check. The walk keeps its open containers on a stack of its
 * own, never in Java frames. It charges one tick per member pair it compares, one per key it collects from each
 * object, and one per started KiB of the shorter of two strings it compares, a key pair included, and the number
 * compare's own; the member walks charge theirs; the sort of a key list charges nothing, and nothing is charged to
 * bytes built (ADR-0037, design approval O1).
