/**
 * The key proof of a document's object (ADR-0044, GLOSSARY "Key proof"): at the start of each walk it finds which of
 * its key entries repeat an earlier one by their decoded bytes, and gives the {@link ObjectWalk} that takes each key
 * once, at its first place with its last value, as jq does (ADR-0002). What it finds lives as long as that walk.
 *
 * <p>Up to {@link #PAIRWISE} key entries, each is compared with the distinct keys before it. Past that, the keys go
 * into an open-addressing table in the run state's scratch ({@link RunState#ints}), a power of two of at least
 * {@link #SLOTS_PER_KEY} slots per key entry and at most {@link #MAX_SLOTS}, each key from its home slot, its
 * {@link #hash} masked, to the next free one. The whole proof may probe {@link #PROBES_PER_KEY} slots per key entry; a
 * probe that compares the bytes of two keys of one length costs one per started KiB of them, at least one. Past that
 * budget (keys built to collide) it sorts the key entries instead, by their unsigned decoded bytes with a stable
 * bottom-up merge sort, jqj's (ADR-0012, F-48), and equal neighbours are repeats. So a proof takes O(key bytes + n log
 * n), never n * n. No repeat leaves the walk without a plan; the first one makes it. A tag-6 key is decoded at most
 * once per proof, the first time a compare or the hash needs its bytes (#85 review).
 *
 * <p>Ticks (ADR-0008 as amended by ADR-0044): one per key entry, or one per started KiB of a longer key's text, and
 * one per compare of the sort, one per started KiB of the shorter key, at least one; the table's probes charge none.
 * A writer's proof charges through {@link RunState#tickWritten}. A host's accessor proves on a run state of its own, so
 * it charges no run.
