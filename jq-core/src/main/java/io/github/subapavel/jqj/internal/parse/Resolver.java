/**
 * Lowers a parsed filter to IR (GLOSSARY "Resolver", ADR-0032), pass 2 after the {@link Binder} (ADR-0040). Built so
 * far (#33, #34, #61, #63): {@code .}; a field by name or by a plain string, {@code .[k]}, {@code .[a:b]} and {@code
 * .[]}, each with its quiet variant {@code ?} (ADR-0034), and a chain of them and {@code |}, which nest as {@code
 * Pipe(term, Intrinsic)}; {@code ,}; parentheses, which make no node; a number or plain string literal, and {@code
 * true}, {@code false} and {@code null}, each a Const; a bare {@code @text}; {@code empty}; and (#64) {@code [e]}, a
 * Collect, and {@code {k: v, ...}}, its pairs bound key-outer around one construction; and (#65) {@code + - * / %},
 * right operand outer, and {@code -t}, each result of {@code t} negated; and (#66) {@code == != < > <= >=}, right
 * operand outer, {@code and}, {@code or} and {@code not}, each an If, and {@code //}, an Alt, both on jq's truth
 * (ADR-0037); and (#67, ADR-0038) {@code E as p | body}, its pattern lowered to Binds in jq's matcher order, and {@code
 * E as p1 ?// p2 ... | body}, an AltBind; {@code $name}, a Var of its slot, a host variable's a parameter slot; {@code
 * $__loc__}, a Const; and a string with interpolations, an Intrinsic of Interpolate over its parts; and (#68, ADR-0039)
 * {@code if ... elif ... else ... end}, nested Ifs, {@code try}, {@code catch} and a postfix {@code ?} on a term that is
 * no step, a Try, {@code error} and {@code error(f)}, and {@code label $name | ...} and {@code break $name}, a Label
 * and a Break of its slot; and (#69, ADR-0041) {@code reduce} and {@code foreach}, a Reduce or Foreach around its
 * pattern's Binds and the Advance of its state slot, and {@code range(a; b)}, an Intrinsic of Range; and (#70,
 * ADR-0040) {@code def}, which makes no node: a call of a definition is its body, inlined; and (#71, ADR-0042) a call
 * of a prelude definition, {@code ..} among them, inlined so too, and an unbuilt native, a Stub; and (#72) the language
 * natives, each an Intrinsic of its operation, {@code last(f)} a Reduce over f. Every other kind is a Stub.
 *
 * <p>A key or bound that is a Const or a Var is the step's argument; any other is bound around the step's target, the
 * key outside the target and {@code a} outside {@code b} (ADR-0034, jq's {@code gen_index} and {@code
 * gen_slice_index}). A comma chain is lowered without recursion over its length: the parser's left-nested spine is
 * flattened by a loop and built again balanced, so its depth is about log2 of its length, with the same results and
 * ticks (F-32). A chain of postfix steps and a run of definitions are lowered by loops too (F-42, #70): a chain's
 * nodes are piped balanced past {@link #PIPE_CHAIN} of them, and a run of more than {@link #STEP_RUN} steps of one
 * result or none is one step that calls them in turn ({@link StepRun}), so a chain's depth does not grow with its
 * length (F-44), with the same results and ticks.
 *
 * <p>The Binder has bound every reference and thrown jq's binding errors, so each name found here has its declaration
 * in the environment ({@link Env}): a slot, a closure or a definition's body. A call of a definition lowers its body in
 * the environment the definition was written in, plus its parameters, with fresh slots for each copy; a filter
 * parameter is the caller's closure, lowered in the caller's environment on the callee's input at each use, and a value
 * parameter {@code $a} is also a Bind of it around the body, the first parameter outermost (ADR-0040). Lowering a call
 * of a recursive definition is a Stub until spec 2b. One compile spends at most {@link #INLINE_CAP} nodes inside
 * expansions, and nests at most {@link #EXPANSIONS} - 1 of them; past either the filter is a Stub (GLOSSARY "Inline
 * cap"), and so is a filter of more than {@link #MAX_IR_DEPTH} levels of IR (F-44). A Stub is thrown at once.
 *
 * <p>A prelude definition's body is written in no environment of the filter's, and every node lowered from it takes
 * the Source of the filter's call that reached the prelude, while a closure argument of the filter keeps its own
 * (ADR-0042 "Source", amending ADR-0031): {@link #here} gives each new node its Source.
