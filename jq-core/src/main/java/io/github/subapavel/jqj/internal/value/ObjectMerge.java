/**
 * jq 1.8.2's object {@code +} ({@code jv_object_merge}) and object merge {@code *} ({@code jvp_object_merge_recursive};
 * GLOSSARY "Object merge"): a growable object of the left object's entries, then each entry of the right one in its
 * key order, a key the left has keeping its place with the right value. Merge goes into the two values of a key when
 * both are objects, building their merge in place of the left value; past {@link #MAX_DEPTH} levels of that it raises
 * jq's catchable "Object merge too deep" (ADR-0029). Each level is a frame of its own stack, never a Java frame. Each
 * level charges a container, then an entry per distinct key as it enters (ADR-0035 amendment), and one tick per entry
 * of its right object; a merge's levels also tick once per left entry they copy, which object {@code +} does not
 * (ADR-0034 amendment). A view's own walks charge theirs.
