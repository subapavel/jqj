/**
 * The parser-action check of a computed object key (ADR-0036, GLOSSARY "Constant key"): a key jq folds to a constant
 * that is no string is jq's error. jq folds what its grammar builds as one constant (jq-ref 1.8.2, observed
 * 2026-11-13): a number, a string without interpolation (its format applies to none), {@code true}, {@code false} and
 * {@code null}; parentheses; a pipe one side of which is {@code .} alone; an array of constants joined by commas that
 * nest to the left only ({@code [(1,2),3]}, not {@code [1,(2,3)]}); and an object whose keys are names, strings or
 * constant strings and whose values are constants, folded as a construction is (a repeated key keeps its first place
 * and its last value). Nothing else folds: {@code 1|2}, {@code -1}, {@code 1?}, {@code [.]} and a key whose value or
 * key is a shorthand or a variable are known only at run time. {@code $__loc__} folds in jq too; it is not built yet, so
 * it is no constant here. An arithmetic operator on two constants folds to its result (#65, {@link #binary}), which the
 * resolver lowers to a Const too. One instance holds one compile's folds (ADR-0035 amendments, #65 third and fourth
 * reviews): each node is folded at most once, its result kept, and every fold charges one run state with the
 * compile's budget; a {@link Program} carries it from the parser to the resolver.
