/**
 * ADR-0042's native table (GLOSSARY "Native table"): every builtin signature jq 1.8.2 writes in C or bytecode, plus
 * F-31's replacing natives, by {@code name/arity}, the input not counted. The {@link Binder} looks it up after the
 * user's definitions and before the prelude; an entry the {@link Binder.Native} enum does not build yet binds as an
 * unbuilt native, whose lowering is a Stub (GLOSSARY "Unbuilt native"). Translated from jq 1.8.2's {@code
 * function_list} (src/builtin.c), its BINOPS (src/builtin.h) and the functions of src/libm.h it includes, {@code
 * bind_bytecoded_builtins} and {@code gen_builtin_list} (src/builtin.c); jq-ref 1.8.2's {@code builtins[]} lists the
 * same signatures but those whose name starts with {@code _} (NativeTableTest).
