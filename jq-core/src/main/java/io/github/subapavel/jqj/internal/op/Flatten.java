/**
 * {@code flatten} and {@code flatten($x)}, jqj's natives in place of builtin.jq's definitions (F-31, ADR-0006
 * amendment, ADR-0042), which they give the results and errors of (jq-ref 1.8.2, recorded: diff/natives.rec flatten-*):
 *
 * <pre>
 * def _flatten($x): reduce .[] as $i ([]; if $i | type == "array" and $x != 0 then . + ($i | _flatten($x - 1)) else . + [$i] end);
 * def flatten($x): if $x &lt; 0 then error("flatten depth must not be negative") else _flatten($x) end;
 * def flatten: _flatten(-1);
 * </pre>
 *
 * So the input's {@code .[]}, its error included, gives the members; a member that is an array is spliced, its own
 * members at the depth less one, while the depth is not 0 by jq's {@code !=}; and the depth less one is jq's {@code -},
 * whose error a depth that is no number raises at the first array member. The depth is checked against 0 in jq's value
 * order first. A walk of nested arrays keeps its open arrays on a stack of its own, never in Java frames, so it is as
 * deep as the data. It ticks once per member it visits, at every level (ADR-0008), and charges the array it builds
 * (ADR-0035).
