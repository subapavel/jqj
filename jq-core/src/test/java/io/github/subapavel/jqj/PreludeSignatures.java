/**
 * The pinned signatures of #71's prelude tests (ADR-0042, GLOSSARY "Prelude", "Native table", "Replaced definition"):
 * builtin.jq's definitions in file order, the prelude definitions whose call is a Stub at #71, and F-31's replaced
 * set. Derived by the test-author from jq 1.8.2's {@code src/builtin.jq}, fetched raw from
 * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jqlang/jq/jq-1.8.2/src/builtin.jq (SHA-256 b8a5fd95…f2a4, the value of
 * {@code jq/SOURCES.sha256}): one entry per top-level {@code def}, its arity the count of its parameters. Cross-check on
 * jq-ref 1.8.2 (2026-11-13): these 106 signatures without the three that start with {@code _}, together with
 * {@code NativeTableTest}'s 142 jq natives without the 19 that start with {@code _}, are exactly the 226 lines of
 * {@code jq-ref -n -r 'builtins[]'}, and no signature is in both lists.
