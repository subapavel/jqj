# Deviations from the reference jq

Behaviours where jqj differs from the reference jq (1.8.2) on purpose, each with its reason and the
decision that made it. A difference not listed here is a bug.

## Path expressions accept only navigation (ADR-0007, issue #6)

`path(f)`, `paths`, `|=` and the other assignments accept a path result only if it comes from the
tracked position through navigation steps and input-preserving control flow, or from the `foreach`
item variable. jq also accepts some other forms; jqj raises "Invalid path expression" for them:

| filter | jq 1.8.2 | jqj |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[1] \| path(. as [$a] \| $a)` | `[0]` | error |
| `{"a":1} \| path(.a \| . as $v \| $v)` | `["a"]` | error |
| `{"a":1} \| path(.a \| true)` | `["a"]` | error |

Reason: jq decides these by value identity, which jqj's views and identity-free numbers do not
have. jq's own test files contain no such case. Relaxing the rule later only turns errors into
results.

## Streaming, when a host enables it (ADR-0007, issue #6)

Streaming is off by default; in that mode jqj behaves like jq. When a host enables streaming for an
eligible filter (`<fixed path> | .[] | rest`):

- **Results before a late error are kept**: results are emitted before a later syntax error is
  seen. jq prints none.
- **Duplicate keys**: a duplicate of a key on the streamed path is not seen. On
  `{"items":[1],"items":[2]}`, jq gives `2`.
